# Verdelix
## Secure data management framework for AI 

Verdelix is a synthesis of two core concepts:

**Verde:** 
Derived from the Spanish and Italian word for "green," which implies environmental, sustainable, or eco-friendly connotations.

**Helix:** 
A term used to describe the spiral structure of a double-stranded DNA molecule in biology. The helix can metaphorically represent structure, continuity, and interwoven elements. In a broader sense, it may signify intertwined data or a structured approach.

Together, Verdelix suggests an eco-friendly, structured, and possibly intertwined or integrated approach, especially when applied to data or technology. It carries both an environmental consciousness and a sense of intricate, yet structured design. The name encapsulates the idea of a sustainable, green approach to structured or complex systems.

## Key Features & SODA Alignment

Below we outline the key features of the framework and how SODA Foundation components support them:

* **Orchestrated Data Lifecycle Management**
    * **SODA Terra:** Provides an API for automated storage provisioning, data movement across storage tiers, and secure deletion aligned with defined policies.

* **Intelligent Distributed Storage**
    * **SODA Terra:** Offers a unified namespace, facilitates data placement based on policies, and serves as the foundation for replication management.

* **Comprehensive Data Provenance**
    * **SODA Terra (with Extensions):** Supports metadata tagging. Potential for deeper integration with future SODA projects specializing in provenance tracking.

* **Enforcement of Data Sovereignty** 
    * **SODA Terra (through Integration):** Integrates with external IAM systems for access control. Provides a policy enforcement layer. Note: Encryption key management often resides outside of core SODA projects.
