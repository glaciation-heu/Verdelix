# Verdelix
Secure data management framework for AI 

Verdelix is a synthesis of two core concepts:

Verde: Derived from the Spanish and Italian word for "green," which implies environmental, sustainable, or eco-friendly connotations.

Helix: A term used to describe the spiral structure of a double-stranded DNA molecule in biology. The helix can metaphorically represent structure, continuity, and interwoven elements. In a broader sense, it may signify intertwined data or a structured approach.

Together, Verdelix suggests an eco-friendly, structured, and possibly intertwined or integrated approach, especially when applied to data or technology. It carries both an environmental consciousness and a sense of intricate, yet structured design. The name encapsulates the idea of a sustainable, green approach to structured or complex systems.
